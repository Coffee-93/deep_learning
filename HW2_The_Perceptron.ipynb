This is because in the second one, we are using the predict function which returns our output of either 1 or 0, and if we run that against the actual data (instance[-1]), we would only obtain the values: -1, 0, and 1. Conversely, the sigmoid function will return continuous values depending on our dot product which is helpful in minimizing error rates since we can determine better accuracy between values that seem close, where our predict function wouldn't give us the granular detail that we need. This helps us better calculate our gradient function for weight updates."
